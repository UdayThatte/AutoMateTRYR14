For Modifying the project to handle Group concept need to modify
1.newver_clientmaster
2.SP Report_InspPerform
3.Report_Insp_Perform.aspx.cs  
4.Login.aspx.cs
5 Site1.Master.cs
6. Report_Pass_Track.apx.cs Pass Track query directly in code
7. SP AuthenticationUser

In table newver_clientmaster
Two fiedls are added GroupID and ClientRole
When single user is there GroupID would be same as ClientID and ClientRole = 1
If a Client is part of larger Group then the Master Client ID would have ClientRole = 1

and other members (ClientID) in the Group would have ClientRole = 0
Index Grp is added on GroupID
